His job is to catch the children if, in their abandon, they come close to falling off the brink; to be, in effect, the "catcher in the rye". The next morning, Holden, becoming increasingly depressed and in need of personal connection, calls Sally Hayes, a familiar date. However, Holden is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is an old friend, Jane Gallagher, whom Holden had romantic feelings for and feels protective of. When his mother returns home, Holden slips out and visits his former and much-admired English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who is now a New York University professor. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey student named Ernest Morrow, and lies to her about himself and her son. Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date. After Luce leaves, Holden gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, and calls an icy Sally.
